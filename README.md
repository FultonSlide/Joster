(Joster) Web Application Development Assignment 1 Swinburne Sem 1 2019

This is a site I put together for my first assignment of class Web Application Development in semester 1 of 2019 at Swinburne University, Melbourne Australia.

The site is a basic job posting site that allows users to post a job with various different criteria the sites "database" which in this assignment had to be a txt file.
Users could then search the "database" for job posts based upon different criteria and have different search results returned to them based on what they searched for.
The results where then returned in order of latest closing date to earliest.

This site was mainly assessed on implementation of php.
